            <li><strong>Preprocessing Necessary for Fast, Accurate \(\mathsf{MIPS}\).</strong> Recent work on the Maximum Inner Product Search problem in \(d\) dimensions has shown that a \(d\epsilon\)-additive error solution is achievable in sublinear time with no preprocessing. This post shows that a reasonably accurate solution, namely one with \(\epsilon\)-relative error, is unachievable in sublinear time without the use of preprocessing. August 2019.

            <li><strong>Investigating \(\boldsymbol{A}_r \otimes \cdots \otimes \boldsymbol{A}_1\) in \(\mathcal{O}(n\log n)\) Time.</strong> We show how one can multiply by and solve systems in an \(n\)-dimensional matrix of the form \(\boldsymbol{A}_r \otimes \cdots \otimes \boldsymbol{A}_1\) extremely quickly. In particular, when all \(\boldsymbol{A}_i\) have the same size, both of these operations can be computed in \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) time. July 2019. [<a href="kronecker.html">Read More</a>]</li>
